Recipe Management and costing module for Odoo ERP suite

The first step in a profitable data-driven restaurant is know the cost of the recipes used in your establishment.

By tying Ingredients to vendors, knowing their Yield Percentage, and calculating the As Served (AS) and Edible Portion (EP) of each item, you can better control costs through better ordering and less wastage.

This module provides a set of new data types for use in recipe costing:

Ingredients - the raw materials of cooking. They are tied to your invenotory system and to suppliers, with conversions between As Ordered Quantity (AOQ) and As Used Quantity (AUQ)

Categories - User-configurable categories for tracking type of ingredient/recipe/dish

Recipes - Assembled with one or more Ingredients, plus instructions for the cooks

Dishes - Assembled from one or more Recipes, these are the plates / menu items as the are served

	This is most useful in the associated Menu Engineering module
